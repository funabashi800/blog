### Research
I'm studying semiconductor engineering in Tokyo University of Science. My reserch goal is developing a simulator with Julia which can compute a quantum effect in an ultra small semiconductor device. And, I'm also studying machine learning to predict material property (ex, Band Gap), on the other hand, computing band structure with VASP (Ab Initio Simulator) is also my specialty.

### Programming
Beside my research in laboratory, I love programming about Web

* Python
* Go
* Node.js
* Julia
* Kotlin

### Hobby
* Netflix (Only Stranger Things so far...)
* Mountain
* Watching Baseball

### Language
* Japanease (native)
