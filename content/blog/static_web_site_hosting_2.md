Hello CoderðŸ¤©! Welcome to my personal blog!
This post will show you how to deploy HUGO static site from GitHub to AWS S3 automatically via TravisCI.

### Create S3 Bucket
First of all, let's make an S3 bucket to host static site, but before that, you need IAM account which has a managed permission to S3 because you have to need to deploy some files via TravisCI programmatically.

After creating a S3 bucket allowed for public access, you need to attach some policy to the S3 bucket, because you are going to upload multiple file to S3 bucket programmatically.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPrivateUpload",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::[Your IAM User Number]:root"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[Your Bucket's Name]/*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[Your Bucket's Name]/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**NOTE** :This policy is essential even if you made configure for static website hosting from GUI

: if your AWS free trier has already been expired, and access I/O is unfrequent, it would be one of the best way to cut down your AWS cost to use [S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/) instaed of standard class


Now you are ready to make CI/CD pipline, but before that, you might as well check if S3 could host index.html as your expectation by uploading all file under public directory manually.

### TravisCI & Github
Before moving on to Deploy, I highly recommend you to install Travis CLI.

```zsh
# Install Travis CLI (NOTE: you have to install ruby also)
$ gem install travis -v 1.8.10 --no-rdoc --no-ri
```
: When I use ```travis``` command I had an error message like below
```
`bin_path': can't find gem travis (>= 0.a) (Gem::GemNotFoundException) from /usr/local/bin/travis:22:in `<main>'
```
But, it worked with sudo permission


Next, you need to describe a detail about your build process after pushing to master branch on GitHub.

```zsh
$ touch .travis.yml
$ sudo travis setup s3
```

Finally, this is my ```.travis.yml```

```yml
language: node_js
node_js:
- node
deploy:
  provider: s3
  access_key_id: [Access Key ID]
  bucket: [Your S3 bucket Name]
  skip_cleanup: true
  local-dir: public
  acl: public_read
  secret_access_key:
    secure: [Encrypted Secret Access Key]
  on:
    repo: [Your Github Repository Name]
```

Now you are ready for everything ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
If you need your own domain name instead of a default S3 bucket URL, I highly recommend to use [name.com](https://www.name.com/), which is available for free if you are stil student. Actually Amazon Route53 is not included in AWS Free tier.
